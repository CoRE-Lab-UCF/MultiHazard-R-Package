\title{Detrends a time series.}
\usage{
Detrend(Data, Method = "window", Window_Width = 89,
  End_Length = 1826, PLOT = FALSE, x_lab = "Data", y_lab = "Data")
}
\arguments{
\item{Data}{Dataframe containing two columns. In column: \itemize{
\item \code{1} A \code{"Date"} object of equally spaced discrete time steps.
\item \code{2} Numeric vector containing corresponding time series values. No \code{NA}s allowed.
}}

\item{Method}{Character vector of length one specifying approach used to detrend the data. Options are moving average \code{"window"} (default) and \code{"linear"}.}

\item{Window_Width}{Numeric vector of length one specifying length of the moving average window. Default is \code{89}, window comprises the observation plus 44 days either side, which for daily data corresponds to an approximate 3 month window.}

\item{End_Length}{Numeric vector of length one specifying number of observations at the end of the time series used to calculate the present day average. Default is \code{1826}, which for daily data corresponds to the final five years of observations.}

\item{PLOT}{Logical; whether to plot origional and detrended series. Default is \code{"FALSE"}.}

\item{x_lab}{Character vector of length one specifying x-axis label. Default is \code{"Date"}.}

\item{y_lab}{Character vector of length one specifying y-axis label. Default is \code{"Data"}.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of the detrended time series.
}
\description{
Detrends a time series using either a linear fit covering the entire dataset or moving average trend correction with a user-sepcified window width.
}
\examples{
#Detrending ocean-side water level at site S22 using a 3 month moving average window and the last five years of observations to calculate the present day average.
Detrend(S22_T_MAX_Daily_Completed_Detrend,Method = "window",Window_Width= 89, End_Length = 1826, PLOT=FALSE,x_lab="Data",y_lab="Data")

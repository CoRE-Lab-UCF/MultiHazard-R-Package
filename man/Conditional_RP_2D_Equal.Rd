Name of the conditioning variable
\item RP_Var1
Return period of variable Con1 i.e., variable in second column of \code{Data}

\item RP_Full_Dependence
Joint return period of the (Var1,Var2) event under full dependence

Graphical output: \itemize{
\item Top Left: Sample conditioned on rainfall (red crosses) and O-sWL (blue circles). Black dot is the event with a marginal return period of the conditioned variable \code{Var_Con} and non-conditioned variable equal to \code{RP_Con} and \code{RP_Non_Con}, respectively. The joint return period of the event using the conditional sampling - copula theory approach and under the assumptions of full dependence and independence between the variables are printed.
\item Top Right: Sample used to estimate the joint return period of the event of interest. Black dots denote the \code{N_Excess} sized subset of the sample where the marginal return period of the conditioned variable \code{Var_Con} exceeds \code{RP_Con} (years). The subset is used to estimate the conditional probabilities in part two of the question.
\item Bottom Left: Conditional Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the non-conditioned variable given the marginal return period of the conditioned variable \code{Var_Con} exceeds \code{RP_Con} years i.e. the black dots in the top right plot.
\item Bottom Right: Conditional return period of the non-conditioned variable given the conditioned variable \code{Var_Con} has a return period longer than \code{RP_Con}.

\description{
A large number of realizations are simulated from the copulas fit to the conditioned samples, in proportion with the sizes of the conditional samples. The realization are transformed to the original scale and the relevant probabilities estimated empirically. The conditional probabilities return period of the conditioning variable equals

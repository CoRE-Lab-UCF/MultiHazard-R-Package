\usage{
C_Sample(Data, Cluster_Max, D, Start, End, Xp)
}
\arguments{
\item{Data}{Vector of the rainfall time series.}

\item{Cluster_Max}{Vector of the index of \code{Data} containing the cluster maximum. If declustering is carried out using \code{Decluster_SW()} set equal to \code{$EventsMax} output.}

\item{D}{Numeric vector of the duration of the cluster maximum events.}

\item{Start}{Numeric vector of the index of \code{Data} where each cluster maximum event begins.}

\item{End}{Numeric vector of the index of \code{Data} where each cluster maximum event ends.}

\item{Xp}{Numeric vector of simulated peaks. To implement the method exactly as in Serinaldi and Kilsby (2013), set equal to a sample (taken with replacement) of the observed cluster maximum (peaks).}
}
\value{
A data frame with the following columns:  \itemize{
\item \code{Xp} Simulated event peaks i.e. input \code{Xp}.
\item \code{D} Duration sampled from the duration vector \code{D} for each simulated event.
\item \code{Samp} Index of the cluster maximum event, sampled conditionally on \code{D}, that provides non-peak rainfall depths.
\item \code{V} Volume of simulated events.
\item \code{Vn} Net volume of simulated events.
\item \code{I} Intensity of simulated events.
\item \code{In} Net intensity of simulated events.
\item \code{Start} Index of \code{Data} where the sampled (\code{Samp}) event begins.
\item \code{End} Index of \code{Data} where the sampled (\code{Samp}) event ends.
}
}
\description{
Implements conditional bootstrap procedure outlined in Serinaldi and Kilsby (2013) to generate non-peak rainfall totals for a simulated peak. The function also calculates hyetograph properties including net characteristics.
